# ISCE_utils
Small utility scripts for working with InSAR Scientific Computing Environment (ISCE) products

ISCE is now on GitHub. See https://github.com/isce-framework/isce2 for more information on ISCE.

Note that this code was written for a much earlier version of ISCE, so it may not work with recent versions.
